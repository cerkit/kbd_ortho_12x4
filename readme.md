## cerkit 12x4 Ortholinear Keyboard for MX style switches

This isn't much to look at. It's basically a board to prevent me from having to handwire the switches. It has the rows and columns exposed as through-holes to attach to the microcontroller of your choice (I'm using a [Proton-C](https://qmk.fm/proton-c/) in my build). It requires 48 diodes arranged at the top of the keyboard. It has 5 M3 holes to use for standoffs.
